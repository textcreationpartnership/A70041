            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <p>That things be carried on by slow but sure proceedings, as a Musician tunes his Instrument by degrees: Lose no opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but yet do not precipitate the work.</p>
                  <p>Let no Prince that is willing despair, for it is an easie thing to change Religion. For when the common people are a while taken with Novelties and diversities of Religion, they will sit down and be aweary, and give up themselves to their Rulers wills.</p>
                  <p>The Doctors and leading Pastors must be put out: but if that may be, all at once: but if that cannot be, let it be by slow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. When the leaders are down all will submit.</p>
                  <p>The purpose of changing Religion, and extirpating <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranism,</hi> must be concealed: Not but that some of the wiser sort may know it, but the People must not, lest it should move them.</p>
                  <p>Some must be suborned to beg importunately of the Prince for Liberty to exercise their Religion, and that with many and gentle words, that so the People may think the Prince is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to Noveity, but only to Lenity, and to a tenderness for tender consciences, and that he doth it not as from himself. For the Vuglar use to commend a Prince, that cannnot deny
<pb facs="tcp:52425:17"/> the Subjects their desires, though they are such as were fit to be denied.</p>
                  <p>One or two Churches only must be desired at first, as being so small a matter, that the people will not much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard.</p>
                  <p>When the Zeal of Professours begins to rise against the change, they are to be pacified by admitting both parties to conference before the Governours.</p>
                  <p>Let there be a Decree for Pacification, that one party do not rail at the other, nor calumniate them. And so the errours that are to be brought in will have great advantage, when they are covered, and may not be contradicted, or so much as named: And so the Rulers will be brought to be onely Lovers of Peace, and not to intend a change of Religion.</p>
                  <p>Next that, let there be some publick Disputation between the Parties, but with some disadvantage to them that are to be outed.</p>
                  <p>Let all this be done but on pretence that the several Parties may be joyned lovingly together in Peace: And when the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters refuse this, let them be accused of unpeaceableness, and pride, and obstinacie, and disobedience against the Magistrate, and not for their Religion.</p>
                  <p>When it comes to the putting out of some Ministers, and the People begin to Petition for them, let the matter be carried si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently; and in the mean time, let the People be told, that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those Ministers are heady, obstinate men; that the People may be perswaded that the Ministers are faulty, and have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served it, and may be put onely to desire Liberty for the more Peaceable men.</p>
                  <p>When thus the people are deluded, and there is no danger of a resistance, then turn the Ministers out of the Churches, and put in those that you would set up in their stead.</p>
                  <p>Then change the Universities, and tell all the Fellows and Scholars, that they shall hold their places if they will turn, else not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> many will change Religion with the Rulers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Next he instanceth in</hi> Asia, <hi>where the Prince pretended, that all the</hi> Professors and Ministers places were void at the death of his Predecessor, and he had the disposal of them, by Law.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:52425:18"/>
                  <p> And the change was there made <hi>(as he pretends)</hi> by slow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, one or two Opinions only changed at the first, and not the whole controverted part of the Religion; and so the people will think it but as a small matter to yeild in one or two Opinions, and be easily brought to obey.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, they fall to writing against each other; and those that have the Court-favour seem to carry it.</p>
                  <p>To put out of Honours, Dignities, and publick offices, all those that are most adverse to Popery: It is but just that those that hinder the safety of the Commonwealth, should be deprived of the Honours and Riches of the Commonwealth. If men are deposed for heynous Crimes, why not for Blasphemy and Contempt of Truth? <hi>(you must believe the</hi> Jesuite <hi>that this is the Protestant Case.)</hi> If those of a contrary Religion be left in honour and power, they will be able to cross the Prince in many things, and encourage the People of their own Religion.</p>
                  <p>That when a Heresie <hi>(for so is the Protestant Religion to them)</hi> is wholly to be rooted out, and this must be done by degrees, and in a way of reason, and cannot be done by meer Command and Power, then you must first fall on those opinions that the Common People are most against, and which you can quickly make them think absurd: <hi>so be instanceth in some</hi> that would work out <hi>Lutheranism,</hi> that speak honourably of <hi>Luther,</hi> and fall on them only under the name of <hi>Flaccians:</hi> so the <hi>Arminians</hi> at <hi>Æ²trecht,</hi> when they would extirpate <hi>Calvinisme,</hi> made a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that no man should Preach any thing, that seemed to make God the Author of sin. Thus a Magistrate that would bring in Popery, must fall upon such heynous opinions, which the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent themselves are half ashamed of; and bring these into the light that they may be odious, and so the Teachers will lose all their Authority, when the people see that they are taken in a manifest fault.</p>
                  <p>To make use of the Protestants Contentions. How easie is it <hi>(faith he)</hi> in <hi>England</hi> to bring the Puritans into Order, if they be forced to approve of Bishops? or to reduce the Puritans in the Low Countries, if the Prince adhere to the <hi>Arminians?</hi> For the variety of Opinions makes them doubtful, that before
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52425:18"/> seemed certain; so that when the Magistrate joyneth with one side, he easily overturns the other, and leaves the whole ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious: As <hi>Paul</hi> did by the dissention between the Pharisees and Sadduces, joyning to one side, he escaped. This <hi>(said he)</hi> I would principally perswade an Orthodox Magistrate to <hi>(that is, a Papist.)</hi> For he may with as much advantage make use of the Protestants disagreements, as of the Papists Concord, to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate Protestants. As in Wars, it is not only the skill and strength of the General, but often also the Carelesness of the Enemy, or his Mistake, that give very great advantages for success. When rigid <hi>Calvinism</hi> was assaulted by the <hi>Lutherans</hi> in the heat of the Paroxysm, it was exasperated, and the suddain restraint did much hurt: But now the <hi>Arminians</hi> have of their own accord let go the hardest part of their rigor, and judge the <hi>Calvinists</hi> to be impious, and persecute them in the very University, and in other Towns they force them to banishment; and would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to do more and crueller things, if they were not afraid of the strength of the adverse Party. Verily if Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> alone did but stand for the <hi>Arminians,</hi> the rigor of the contra-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants would flag, or be broken.</p>
                  <p>To forbid the Protestants privately or publickly to Assemble together.</p>
                  <p>To proceed to severity of Laws and punishments. Here he endeavours to prove this violence lawful, <hi>(Fire and fagot, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to the last.)</hi> But this violence though it must be for the change of all, need not be exercised on all. Cut off the Leaders, and the multitude will follow the Authority of the Rulers. Shame will retain some, and fear others; but a vain security will prevail with most, when they know not how to help it. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in these few years, <hi>(if he say true,)</hi> above an hundred thousand have been turned to Popery in <hi>France,</hi> and more in <hi>Germany.</hi> Not any of the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> that did endeavour to draw over his People to the Catholicks, did ever finde any force or Resistance contrary to his Laws. <hi>Note this all you slanderous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists that accuse Protestants so much of Rebellion to hide your own: Here's a</hi> Jesuites <hi>Testimony on Record for our vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>He commendeth many smaller helps: As 1. Musick, to entise people by delight. 2. To cause all at their marriage to profess the Popish Religion, and so rather then go without a Wise or Husband they will do it. 3. So also to deny Protestants Church-Priviledges, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly he concludes, That where the work must be secretly done by degrees, the Magistrate must keep the Institution, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation, Confirmation, and Examination of Ministers in his own hand; and so (if he cannot cast them out at once) he must cast out the most dangerous, <hi>(that is, ablest Protestant Pastours)</hi> and put over the Churches, the disagreeing, and those that do not minde matters of Controversie much, and those that are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to their own Domestick businesses <hi>(worldly men,)</hi> and such as are addicted to the Rulers: Let him cool the heat of Heresie, <hi>(he means true Religion)</hi> and let him not put out the Unlearned: and so their Religion will grow into contempt.</p>
                  <p>Let the Magistrate cherish the Dissentions of the erring <hi>(he means the Protestant)</hi> Teachers: and let him procure them often to debate together, and reprove one another. For so when all men see that there is nothing certain among them, they will easily yeild to the truth <hi>(he means Popery.)</hi> And this Discord is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to shew the manners of those wicked men. For he that will read the Contentious Writings of <hi>Lutherans</hi> against <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists,</hi> or <hi>Calvinists</hi> against <hi>Lutherans,</hi> will think he readeth, not the invectives of men against men, but the furies and roaring of Devils against Devils. <hi>(A fair warning! But the Jesuite tells you not what is done at home.)</hi> From these things the Ruler may take occasion for a change: Let him enquire into the Original of these accusations: And if he finde them true; he may punish the Guilty: If false, he may punish, <hi>(that is, cast out)</hi> the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THe Jesuites crept into all societies, and acted all parts; and being a foreseeing generation, they lookt further before them then the short-witted men whom they over-reacht. They set up persecutions and clamours against Bishops, and the ablest Ministers in the Land: (for it was the Papist that set up the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position against Bishops, as appears by father <hi>Sibthorp</hi>'s Letter to father <hi>Medcalf,</hi> who saith, <hi>And now they are pulling down that wall which at once adorned and defended their way, I mean their Government: their Vineyard (as they used to preach) is laid waste, and the wilde beasts of the forest (you know whom they mean) may enter in:)</hi> and upon that ground they proceed so sure, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things happen, they have their advantage. They see this attempt will prevail against the Governours and Government of the Church, or it will not: if it doth, then all the ablest and wisest men are like to be removed, and their places filled with weak and ignorant men, unable to resist them; and ductile world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, that will always be on the stronger side, and their ends will be easily attained. But if there be any opposition, murmuring, discontents, either it will provoke the Discontented to open de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and resistance, or not: if not, their discontents will hurt none but themselve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>: if it do, then either they will be crusht in the beginning, or able to bring it to a war. If the first, then we shall have the day, and this to boot, that they will lie under the <hi>odium</hi> of Rebellion, and be trod the lower, and be the less able ever to rise, and we shall be able with ease to drive on the change to a higher degree, in opposition to so odious a party. But if they be able to make a war of it, either they will be conquered, or conquer, or make peace. The last is most unlikely, because jealousies and engagements will presently be multiplyed, so that an apparent necessity will seem to lie on each party not to trust
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52425:20"/> the other; and the flames are easier to be kept in, then kindled: and if so unlikely a thing should come to pass, yet it must needs be to our advantage. For we will openly all appear for the King, and so in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> we shall be considerable. He will remember that he was helpt by us, and look on the Protestants and Puritans as Rebels, and take his next advantage against them, or at least be at a greater distance from them then before: for such a war will never out of his minde, nor will he think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self safe till he hath disabled them from doing the like again. But if one part conquer, it will be the King, or the Puritans: (for so the Protestants must now be called:) If the King prevail, then will the Puritans be totally trod down; and we, by whose help the victory was got, shall certainly be incomparably better then we are, if not have presently all our will. For our fidelity will be predicated, the Rebels will be odious, so that their very names will be a scorn, and there will be no great resistance of us. But if the Puritans get the day, (which is a most unlikely thing) yet shall we make great advantage of it: For, 1. They will be unsetled and all in pieces, and not know how to settle the Government. 2. We shall necessitate the Puritan Protestants to keep the King as a prisoner, or else to put him to death. If they keep him as a prisoner, his diligence, and friends, and their own divisions, will either work his deliverance, and give him the day again by our help, or at least will keep the State in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual unsetledness, and will be an <hi>Odium</hi> on them. If they cut him off, (which we will rather promote, left they should make use of his extreamities to any advantage) then, 1. We shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the <hi>Odium</hi> of <hi>King-killing</hi> to fall upon them, which they are wont to cast upon us, and so shall be able to disburden our selves. 2. And we shall have them all to pieces in distractions. For, 3. Either they will then set up a new King, or the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will keep the power, changing the Government into a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy. The first cannot be done without great Concussions, and new wars, and we shall have an opportunity to have a hand in all; and if it be done, it may be much to our advantage. The second will apparently by factions and distractions give us footing for continual attempts. But to make all sure, we will secretly have our party among the Puritans also, that we may be sure to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52425:20"/> maintain our interest which way ever the world goes.] The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent with common reason and many full discoveries shew, that this was the frame of the Papists plot.</p>

                  <p>VVhence came the Doctrine contended for by Sir <hi>H. V.</hi> and others, against the power of the Magistrate in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and for universal liberty in Religion? I know the Papists are not for such liberty in <hi>Spain,</hi> or any where, where they can hinder it: but withal I know, that it is one of their Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, that such matters belong onely to the Pope and Prelates, and Magistrates must but be their Executioners; and I know that it is truly the Magistrates power for which the usurping Pope contendeth: and I know that the Papists are most zealous for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of conscience in <hi>England,</hi> though deadly enemies to it else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
                  <p>Whence came it to pass, that <hi>Sarabras</hi> the Queens Confessor, was present at the Kings death, and there on horse-back, tossing up his Cap in the Air upon the fatal blow, and brandishing his sword? and when he was asked what he did there, and told it was a wonder to see him there: he answered, <hi>That there were twenty more Priests there besides himself; and that the greatest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to their Religion fell that day.</hi> Few knew the consequence of that fact.</p>

                  <p>How came our Armies so corrupted with principles of impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, licentiousness and Anarchy, that so many turned Levellers, (to say nothing of all the rest) and rose up against their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, and were fain to be subdued by force, and some of them shot to death, and many cashiered? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>How came it to pass, that the Petitions of the Protestant Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of <hi>London,</hi> and of other Protestants for the life of the King, could not be heard? but that the Levelling party carried on their work, till they had set the forreign and domestick Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists on reproaching the Protestants as King-killers? and had (though very falsly) turned the <hi>odium</hi> of that horrid kinde of crime upon the innocent Protestants, which the Papists are known to be most deeply guilty of: and now in all Nations they make the ignorant people believe, that the death of that King was the work of the Protestants, and the blot of their Religion.</p>
                  <p>Whence came it to pass, that so many Popish opinions were maintained? As, 1. The Authority of Scriptures was cryed down. 2.

That Sacraments are not seals of the promises of God, nor instituted to confirm the promise. 7. That circumcision was a seal of the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Faith onely to <hi>Abraham.</hi> 8. That the Ordinances of God are not effectual in the hands of unholy men; as if the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the Ordinance depended on the goodness of men; and,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52425:21"/> as the Papists say, the intention of the Administrator is necessarily required to the truth of the Sacrament. 9. That all that was established among us was Popish, until at last we have no Religion but Popery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Whence comes it to pass that we cannot be satisfied under the best Government in the world? yea, under any?

                  <p>Whence comes this restlesness of ours, but from the influence of a forreign power upon us? And what forreign power hath the like influence upon us to that of the Pope?</p>
                  <p>VVhence comes it to pass, that Levelling went on with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued success, till the House of Lords, with the Regal Office, was taken down, and an Engagement put (on all those ductile souls that would take it) to be <hi>True to the Commonwealth, as established without a King or house of Lords?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>VVhence came it that the weekly News-books contained the Letters of the Agents of the Agitators from <hi>France,</hi> telling us how good men the Jesuites were, and how agreeable to them in their principles for a Democracy, (which they vainly call a Republick, as if there were no Commonwealth, but a Democracy) and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us, what exceeding meet materials for such a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth the Jesuites would be? The Agencies of particular men with Jesuites, I shall purposely omit.</p>
                  <p>Whence came it that all the maddest dividing parties had their liberty, and the reproach and envy was most against the united Ministry?</p>
                  <p>Much more may be proposed tending to a discovery, how far the Papists have crept in among us, and had to do in our affairs. But I think God hath yet much more in season to discover. Truth is the daughter of time.</p>

                  <p>As for the old English Bishops and conformable Ministers, who were of the faith and doctrine publickly here professed, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess I finde but little evidence that ever the Papists had much to do with them.</p>
                  <p>As for the Presbyterians, I do not see any reason to think that ever the Papists had any interest in them of any men, there being none that they more hate then these two sorts (the old sound Episcopal men, and the Presbyterians) But yet both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> they have cunningly wrought upon them <hi>ab extra,</hi> alarming them into disturbances by the wild-fire which they have cast in.</p>
                  <p>As for the King himself that was their Head, if any conjecture that he was a flat Papist, as I have heard many rashly say, I think there is much evidence to confute them. 1. That very letter to the Pope (forementioned) on which the suspicion is most ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if you mark it exactly, doth intimate no more then a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of a union and Reconciliation, with some additio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> that may bear a tolerable sence. 2. His own Profession of the Protestant Religion is sufficient evidence. 3. His Disputation with the Marquess of <hi>Worcester</hi> cleareth it. 4. His speech at death, and Papers since published, clear it more.</p>
                  <p>Yea for my own part I am perswaded, that the Papists were as much afraid of King <hi>Charls</hi> and the <hi>Grotion</hi> design, as of any thing that of long time hath been hatcht against them. They are not all of a minde at home. And hence was the malice of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites against the life of the King (and withal, that he was faln into such hands where he was like to do them little service.)</p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:52425:22"/>
                  <p> The persecuted Nonconformists of the Protestant party, though they were most adverse to the Papists, yet had some of the Popish brood at last crept in among them, not only to spie out their minds and ways, but to head the party, and sow among them the seed of further discontent and errour, and to make them a Nursery for various sects. For every where by their good will the Jesuites will have some. If you ask me for my proof of this, I shall at this time give you but these two. 1. The fruits that sprung up from among them, and the manner of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, (of which more anon.) 2. The words of the Jesuites Letter recited by Mr. <hi>Pryn, Introd. pag.</hi> 90. <hi>[I cannot chuse but laugh to see how some of our own coat have re-incounted themselves: you would scarce know them if you saw them; and it is admirable how in speech and gesture they act the Puritans: The</hi> Cambridge <hi>Scholars to their woful experience shall see, we can act the Puritans a little better then they have done the Jesuites: they have abused our sacred Patron St.</hi> Ignatius <hi>in jest, but we will make them smart for it in earnest.

And too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more have more cleanly plaid their game. And though many of the more sober Anabaptists would not be so useful to the Papists as they expected, yet multitudes of them too far an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered their expectations.</p>
                  <p>If you ask now what the Papists get by all this; I answer, you see in the Instance but of this one fact, and the products of it.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52425:23"/> 1. By this means our Councils, Armies, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>uches have been divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or much broken. 2. By this trick they have engaged the minds and tongues of many (and their hands, if they had power) against the Ministry, which is the enemy that standeth in the way. 3. They have thus weakned us by the loss of our former adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. 4. They have found a Nursery or Seminary for their own Opinions, which one half of the Anabaptists too greedily receive. 5. By this they have prepared them for more and worse. 6. By this means they got an Interest in our Armies, or weakned our own. 7. By this they have got Agents ready, for mischiveous designs (as hath been lately too manifest.) 8. By this they have cast a reproach upon our Profession, as if we had no unity or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence, but were vertiginous for want of the Roman pillar to rest upon. 9. By this they have loosned and disaffected the common people, to see so many mindes and ways, and hear so much contending, and have loos'd them from their former sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastness, and made them ready for a new impression. 10. Yea by this means they have the opportunity of Predicating their own pretended unity, and hereby have drawn many to their Church of late. All this have they got at this one game. What then have they got by all the rest?</p>
                  <p>I shall next tell you of some of those Heresies or parties among us, that are the Papists own Spawn or progeny; Either they laid the Egg, or hatched it, or both.</p>
                  <p>And 1. It is most certain that <hi>Libertinism</hi> or <hi>Freedom for all Religions,</hi> was spawned by the Jesuits, who hate it in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi> but love it in <hi>England.</hi> I have met with the masked Papists my self, that have been very zealous and busie to promote this <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi> (as they deceitfully call it.) For by this means they may have Liberty for themselves, and Liberty to break us in pieces by sects, and also Liberty under the Vizor of a Sectary of any tolerated sort, to oppose the Ministry and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of truth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But the principal design that the Papists have upon our Religion, at this day, is managed under a sort of <hi>Juglers,</hi> who all are confederate in the same grand principles, and are busie at the same work, and are agreed to carry it on in the dark, and with wonderful secrecy do conceal the principal part of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52425:23"/> but yet they use not all one vizor, but take on them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral shapes and names; and some of them industriously avoid all names. The principal of these <hi>Hiders</hi> are these following. 1. The <hi>Vani,</hi> whose game was first plaid openly in <hi>America</hi> in <hi>New England,</hi> where God gave in his Testimony against them from Heaven upon their two Prophetesses, Mrs. <hi>Hutchinson,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Dyer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next sort of <hi>Hiders,</hi> are the <hi>Paracesians, Weigelians,</hi> and <hi>Behmenists,</hi> who go the same way in the main with the former, and are inded the same party, but think meet to take another name, and fetch their vizor from <hi>Jacob Behmen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another sort of the <hi>Hiders</hi> are those called <hi>Seekers,</hi> among whom I have reason to believe the Papists have not the least of their strength in <hi>England</hi> at this day. They practise the lesson that <hi>Boverius in Apparat. ad Consultat.</hi> taught Prince <hi>Charls</hi> long ago <hi>[Primum est, ut quoniam vera Religio tibi inquirenda est, ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ad eam investigandam accedas, omnem prius Religionem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud te suspectam habeas: lubeat{que} tamdiu Ã  Protestantium fide ac Religione animum ac voluntatem suspendere, quamdiu in veri in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitione versaris.â]</hi> We must suspect all Religion it seems, and be first of no Religion, if we will become Papists. A fair beginning! We must then be unchristned, and suspect Christ and Scripture, that we may be espoused to the Pope. And this is the Papists work by the <hi>Seekers,</hi> to take us off from all, or from our former Religion, and blot out all the old impressions, that we may be capable of new. And if they can accomplish this, they have us at a fair advantage. For he that is not a stark Atheist or Infidel, but believes that he hath a soul to save or lose, must need<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap> know the Necessity of seeking his Salvation in some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or other; and therefore take him off from this, and you must needs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>ãâ¦ã</desc>
                     </gap>g him to some other: And he that could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to take him off his old Religion, is likeliest to have so much interest in him as may also prevail to bring him to another. And the Papist thinks that on the pretence of Unity, Antiquity and Universality (of which indeed they have but a delusory show) they can put as fair for him that is once indifferent, as any other can.</p>
                  <p>Of these <hi>Seekers</hi> there are these sub-divisions, or Sects. The
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52425:24"/> first and most moderate do only profess themselves to be <hi>Seekers</hi> for the <hi>true Church and Ministry;</hi> holding that such a Church and Ministry there is, but they are at a loss to know which is it.</p>
                  <p>The second sort of <hi>Seekers</hi> are to seek whether there be any Organized Political Church, or any Ministery, or any Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances proper to a Church at all, or not. Not denying them, but <hi>Doubting</hi> and <hi>Seeking;</hi> that so when they have found them at <hi>Rome,</hi> they may prove but <hi>Finders,</hi> and not gross changlings.</p>
                  <p>Another sort of <hi>Seekers</hi> are those that do not only <hi>Doubt</hi> of, but <hi>flatly deny any Ministry,</hi> and Political Churches, and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinances on Earth, as things that are lost in an <hi>Æ²niversal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another sort of <hi>Seekers</hi> do not only <hi>doubt of or deny</hi> these <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> but also they are to <hi>seek for the Æ²niversal Church it self,</hi> and the <hi>holy Scriptures;</hi> yea many of them not only <hi>Questioning</hi> them, but flatly maintaining, that we have no certainty that the Scripture is true, or that we have the same that was written by the Apostles, or that there is such a thing as a true Ministry, or Seat of Christianity in the World. It's most evident therefore that this is but a Juggle, and that such are either <hi>Infidels or Papists.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A fifth sort called <hi>Seekers</hi> also there are that own the Church and Ministry, and Ordinances; but yet suppose themselves above them.</p>
                  <p>And a sixth sort of <hi>Seekers</hi> there are that think the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of believers should now be over-grown the Scripture, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry and Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>All these sorts of <hi>Seekers</hi> are bred or cherished by the <hi>Jesuites and Fryars.</hi> And the truth is, when a man is ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

                     <hi>Seeker,</hi> he is half made a Papist: As a Dog when he hath lost his Master will follow almost any body that will whistle him; so when men have lost their Ministry, Church and Religion, they are easily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> For they are a body as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous to a carnal eye as any other. And who will not rather be of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church and Religion then of none?</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:52425:24"/>
                  <p> Another sort of <hi>Hiders</hi> are the <hi>Quakers:</hi> an impudent Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and open enough in pulling down, but as secret and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served as the rest in asserting and building up. What interests the Papists have in breeding and seeding this Sect among us, hath been partly proved from the Oaths of witnesses, and Confessions of Fryars.</p>
                  <p>A fifth sort of <hi>Hiders</hi> are those Enthusiasts that shun the affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bombasted language of <hi>Behmen,</hi> and such-like, but yet give us much of the body of Popery, headed by an infallible prophetick Spirit, in stead of the Pope. Such as the Authors of the Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Assemblies Confession, owned by <hi>Parker,</hi> but said to be written by a <hi>London-</hi>Doctor. And many such Doctors I know and hear of abroad in <hi>England.</hi> They take upon them to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries to the Pope, but they are friends to his Doctrines, and maintain the necessity of an infallible living Judge, and send us to Prophets for this infallible judgement. And could the Papists bring men once to this, it is an easie matter to strike off the seign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prophetick head, by disgracing such as meer fantasticks, and to set on the ancient Papal head, which onely will agree with the body they have received. So much of the Libertines and Hiders of their Religion, (of all sorts.)</p>
                  <p>Another sort that are spawned by the Papists, are stark Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, Atheists or Infidels. Not that they desire that men should be absolutely and finally Infidels: But, 1. They would make the world believe, that all must be Infidels that will not receive the Christian Faith upon the Roman account and terms: and in order to this, they industriously seek to disgrace the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and overthrow all the grounds of the Faith of such as they dispute with; and so make them Infidels in order to the proof of that their affirmation. 2. And then they think they must take them off all Religion, to prepare them for the Popish Religion. 3. And the malice of some of them is such, that they had rather men were Infidels then Protestants: or at least they will venture them upon infidelity in the way, rather then not take them off from being Protestants. And no wonder, when they allow Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels so much more charity then Protestants, as to their salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for <hi>Rome</hi> burneth Protestants, but giveth toleration for Jews. And thus by these Devillish devices, the Hiders in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:52425:25"/> that keep close their Religion, are discovered at last to be one part of them Infidels or Heathens, and another part of them Papists. And no wonder if they would lately have introduced the Jews here into <hi>England,</hi> and if they have so many other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes to promote this Apostacie.</p>

                     <p>How the Jesuites hide themselves, and how they may be discovered.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AGain, they carry on their designe by hiding themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and by peculiar dispensations coming to any of our Assemblies, or joyning in worship with any party either good or bad.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the principal means by which they conceal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, is, By thrusting themselves into all Sects and Parties, and putting on the vizor of any side, as their cause requireth. It is well known that formerly we had an abundance of them that went under the name of Protestants, and were commonly called <hi>Church-Papists:</hi> but there is great reason to think that there is more such now. Some of them call themselves <hi>Independents,</hi> some creep in among the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and some go under the cloak of <hi>Arminians,</hi> and some <hi>Socinians,</hi> and some <hi>Millenaries,</hi> and all the other sects before-mentioned. They animate the <hi>Vanists,</hi> the <hi>Behmenists,</hi> and other Enthusiasts; the <hi>Seekers,</hi> the <hi>Quakers,</hi> the <hi>Originist,</hi> and all the Juglers and Hiders of the times: it is they that keep life in <hi>Libertinisms,</hi> and in Infidelity it self. Among every one of these parties you m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>m, if you have the skill of unmasking them.</p>
                  <p>Another way of hiding themselves, is, By having a Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to come to any of our Assemblies, or joyn in worship with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny party, good or bad: or else they will prove it lawful with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Dispensation, where the Pope interdicteth it not. And their way is this: That all the old known Papists, especially of the poorer sort, shall be still forbidden to come to our Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, lest they bring the blot of levity and temporizing on their
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52425:25"/> Religion, and lest there should not be a visible party among them to countenance their cause. But the new Proselytes, especially such as are of any power and interest in the world, and may do them more service in a masked way, and can fairly avoid the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Popery, these shall have leave to come to our Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, when their cause may make advantage of it.</p>
                  <p>That you may see I feign not all this of them, (besides the proof from certain experience, which we dayly see) let me lay before you the Decisions of one of their principal <hi>Directors,</hi> in this work of propagating their Faith; and that is, <hi>Thom.

So that the Papists are abundantly provided for their security, against such as would discover them, when it stands not with their ends to disclose themselves.</p>
                  <p>Another most effectual way of <hi>Hiding themselves</hi> is, by <hi>Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> or <hi>mental reservations,</hi> which we use to call Lying, when they are examined about their Religion, their Orders or their actions. Lying that hurteth not another, they commonly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to be but a venial sin, which, say most of them, is properly no sin at all. And to equivocate or reserve one half of your answer to your selves, say the Jesuites, is not Lying, nor unlawful, in case a mans interest requireth him to do it. See the words of their own Casuists cited for this by <hi>Montaltus the Jansenist.</hi> Were it a thing that needeth proof, I would give you enough of it. <hi>Thom. a Jesu the Carmelite, ubi sup. Dub.</hi> 4. <hi>pag</hi> 218. secureth them sufficiently: His Question is <hi>[Whether one that denyeth it when he is asked of a Heretick whether he be a Priest, or a Religious man, or whether he heard Divine service, do sin against the confession of faith?]</hi> He answereth, <hi>[No: for that is no denying himself to be a Christian, or Catholick: For it is lawful to dissemble or hide the person of a Clergy man or a Religious man, without a lye in words, lest a man be betrayed and indanger of his life; and for the same cause he may lay by his Habit, omit prayers,</hi> &amp;c.<hi>âbecause humane Laws for the most part bind not the subjects conscience, when there is great hazard of life, as in this case</hi> Azorius <hi>hath well taught.

                  <p>Yea that the Pope can sufficiently dispense with any of their Oaths of fidelity or Allegiance, or the like, I shall shew you under the last Detection. The Parliament hath imposed on them an Oath
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52425:26"/> of Abjuration: but do they not know how little the Clergy, and such as have their countenance, will stick at that? such Nets are too wide to catch them in. Hear the words of one of their own Priests <hi>(Jo. Browns Voluntary Confess. in Pryns Introduct. p.</hi> 203.) saith he, <hi>[It's strange to see the Stratagems which they use with their penitents concerning the Oath of Allegiance! If they be poor, they tell them flatly, (when they are demanded to take the Oath) that it is damnable, and no ways to be allowed by the Church: If they be of the richer sort, they say they may do as their conscience will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire them. And there be some of them that make no conscience at all, to have it taken so oft as they are demanded.]</hi> What would you have more, then such discoveries by themselves?</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>How we may discover the Papists, when they are masked.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>YOu have cause to <hi>suspect</hi> all that use a <hi>Mask,</hi> and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely hide their minds. To suspect them, I say, to be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists or worse: They walk not in Gods way that walk in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: It is the Kingdom of Satan that is the Kingdom of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and it is he that is the Prince of Darkness, and his servants that are the sons of Darkness.</p>
                  <p>And therefore the <hi>Vane</hi> and <hi>Steril</hi> language of Paracelsian Behmenists, and Popish Juglers, doth serve with me for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther use but to raise me into suspicion of their Designs and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and to signifie a <hi>Vain</hi> and <hi>Steril</hi> minde.</p>
                  <p>The Jugling Papists may be known by this, that they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways loosening people from their Religion, and leading them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a dislike of what they have been taught; that they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive of their new Impressions. And therefore of any one Sect in <hi>England,</hi> there is none to be so much suspected of a spirit of <hi>Jesuitism,</hi> as the <hi>Seekers</hi> of all sorts.</p>
                  <p>The Jugling Papists may be much detected by this, that they are all upon the <hi>Destructive</hi> part in their Disputes, and very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle on the <hi>Assertive</hi> part. They pull down with both hands, but
<pb facs="tcp:52425:27"/> tell you not what they will build up, till they have prepared you for the discovery. They tell you what they are against: But what they are for, you cannot draw out of them. As if any wise man will leave his house or grounds till he knows where to be better: or will forsake his staff that he leaneth on, or the food that he feedeth on, till he know where to have a better provision or support. Do they think wise men will be made irreligious? They deal by the poor people, as one that should say to passengers on Shipboard <hi>[What fools are you to venture your lives in such a ship that hath so much encumbrance and danger, and so many flaws, and but a few inches between you and death, and is guided by such a Pilot as may betray you or east away your lives for ought you know?]</hi> They know now that none but mad men will be perswaded by such words as these to leap into the Sea to scape these dangers: and therefore they do this but to make men willing to pass into their ship, and take them for our Pilots. If you are wise therefore, hold them to it, and leap not over-board, but keep where you are, till they have shewed you a safer Vessel and Pilot: which they can never do.</p>
                  <p>And you may strongly conjecture at the quality of these Juglers, by their constant <hi>opposition against the Ministry.</hi> It is <hi>Ministers</hi> that are their eye-sores; the hinderers of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: Could they but get down these, the work was done, the day were their own: And therefore their main business, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever vizor they put on, is to bring the people into a dislike or contempt of the Ministry. If they seem Quakers, they will rail at them: If they seem Seekers, they will dispute against their calling: If they seem the gentlest Behmenists, they have their girds at them, to acquaint the world that they are misgui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>ãâ¦ã</desc>
                     </gap> by them. But at first, they will not let you know which is the true Ministry, if ours be not; or which is the true Church, if ours be not: Here they leave you.</p>
                  <p>The Jugling Papist, what vizor soever he wears, is commonly putting in for his own opinions, of the <hi>Necessity of a Judge of Controversies, an Infallible Church, a state of perfection here, the magnifying of our own inherent Righteousness,</hi> without any great esteem of <hi>of Justification by the forgiveness of sin:</hi> and many such like.</p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:52425:27"/>
                  <p> Papists have still an aking tooth at the <hi>Authority and sufficiencie of Scripture;</hi> and therefore on one pretence or other are still disgracing and impugning it, and leading men aside to some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rule.</p>
                  <p>Papists have still an enmity against the <hi>Power of the Magistrate in matters of Religion:</hi> For in such matters their <hi>Vice-christ</hi> must be the only Judge. Whereas indeed, by that time the <hi>Magistrate</hi> hath judged, <hi>Who is Punishable by the Sword,</hi> and the <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Particular Churches</hi> have judged, <hi>Who is excommunicable,</hi> (which are their undoubted works) there is nothing left for a Pope to do. Suspect them that are for Liberty for all; or at least for all that are no worse then Papists. They that set open this door, intend to creep in at it themselves at last.</p>
                  <p>And it is a suspicious sign when you finde men enemies to the Unity, Peace and Settlement of our Churches, but would still keep us in division and distraction. And yet some of these men will lament our Divisions, and cry up Unity, but they will secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hinder it, or do nothing to attain it.</p>
                  <p>And it is somewhat suspicious to see men hang loose from all our Churches in their practice, and joyn with none, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in the Sacraments. If they know not Sacraments and Church-communion to be both our Duty, and the Means of our strength and comfort, it is doubtful whether they are Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans or Infidels. But if they know this of the Necessity and use of Sacraments, and Church-communion in general, and yet joyn not with any of our Churches herein, it's a shrewd suspition that they have an eye upon some other Church. For sure a tender conscience would not be many years in resolving of so great and practical a point, no more then he would live many years with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prayer, on pretence of being unsatisfied in the mode of Prayer.</p>
                  <p>And yet on the contrary side, there are some Jugling Papists, especially in our Councils, Civil and Ecclesiastick, that play their game by over-doing, and making every thing to be Popish and Antichristian, to drive us into extreams, and into opinions in which we may easily be baffled. And it's not a little that they have won of us at this game.</p>

               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Of the King, whom neither Popish favours could invite to their way, nor Protestant affronts could provoke from ours.</item>
                  <item>2. Of the Parliament, who are so resolved against Popery.</item>
                  <item>3. Of the Bishops, who will be all mixed, if ever Popery should come.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="2">2. Publickly to agree, declare and instruct men what is Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and what is not; lest under that notion all laudable, ancient,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52425:28"/> necessary and pious instructions, when displeasing, should be cast off under the name of Popery; and lest any antiquated supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or heresie should be received under the notion of new lights, or of order and decency.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Policy</hi> 2. You would do well to make it appear under-hand how near the Doctrine, Worship and Discipline of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> comes to us: how willingly (as our good Brother speaks) <note place="margin">See Jesuit.

               <p>
                  <hi>Advice</hi> 1. That we, considering that <hi>Rome</hi> hath been a pure Church, and so blessed with pure Doctrine, Usages and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, think never the worse of any thing warranted by Divine Rule, for being like to what is used in that Church, and avoid nothing meerly because it is used in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Policy</hi> 3. Let there be that <hi>odium</hi> by writing and secret pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices raised upon the Factious, that the Law may be so intent upon them that you may escape; and those troublesome persons may be disabled from speaking against you as they used to do, being odious in the eye of the Law and the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Advice.</hi> Indeed there are those dangerous persons of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions, contrary to the established way, that make that use of all publick Dissents for private Designes, that the Law must watch all Dissenters. Yet so impartially should this be done, and so carefully, that one party should not over-run us while we are suppressing the other: yea, and while the Law doth lay hold of so many of our unhappy Brethren, we should endeavour that good understanding with those of them that are honest, as not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all insinuations to the contrary, might bring them over to us, or at least might perswade them to joyn with us, as
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52425:29"/> in an unanimous Declaration against Popery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Policy</hi> 4. Let the power of the King in matter of Religion be decryed; or at least let there be an indulgence promoted by the Factions, and seconded by you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Advice.</hi> Let us (as all the Protestants, <hi>Jewel, Reynolds, Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Hooker, Andrews,</hi> &amp;c. hitherto) maintain that great Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-truth, The power of the Civil Magistrate, as a Nursing Father, to be a terrour to all evil-doers, and an encouragement to them that do well; that we may live under him peaceable and quiet lives, in all godliness and real honesty: <hi>i. e.</hi> his power in keeping up the true Religion, against all persons whatever, who have been taught by the Papists to deny that power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us be perswaded that the Magistrate is to exercise this power according to his own conscience, and not according to his subjects opinion; according to the publick reason of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and not according to the private reason of any man; and that to indulge any known errour, is to destroy Government, it being the ready way to indulge all: and what use is there of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment where all things are lawful?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Policy</hi> 5. You may have such insight into the trade and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Nation, that you may have the one engrossed between your selves and other discontented parties, and the other stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: so that the inhabitants will for want either endeavour an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration at home, or transplant themselves among us abroad; so that we may either joyn with them, or they with us, in order to the main designe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Advice.</hi> It were well if those honest men that have got mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney did lay it out by way of Loan, or otherwise, so as that trade might go on cheerfully; and that for their encouragement the interest of money were raised from 6 to 8 or 10 in the hundred: and that all traders were advised with touching the several ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions in their Occupations. Neither were it amiss that a strict eye were had upon Dissenters, and that Poenal Laws did draw out some of that wealth for publick benefit which they retain for private designe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Policy</hi> 6. It were well if you took all just occasion to make it plain to the people, that there is no true ordination or succession of Bishops, Pastors and Ministers in <hi>England;</hi> and that they who
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52425:29"/> are pretended Bishops and Ministers, are either worldly and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less on the one hand, or so factious on the other hand, that it were well they were removed: however, it were well the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should be taken off from them by a clear discovery of their unworthiness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Advice</hi> 1. Though we need not fetch our Ordination from <hi>Rome,</hi> yet as to them our people may truely know, that if they have any true Ordination or Ministry, then so have we: for our first Reformers were ordained by their Bishops.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And our people may know, that the Papists are as much at a loss as we: for they have had many Popes at a time, and no man knoweth which is the right Pope to this hour: yea, they have had such vacancies, removes and interruptions of Hereticks, Infidels, Murtherers, Adulterers, in stead of Popes, (as their own Histories make manifest) that there is nothing more certain then that their succession hath been interrupted in the persons upon whom their Religion depends: for their Religion depends wholly upon the Pope.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All sides among Protestants may now seasonably declare, That they finde our Ministry of God by the success it hath had for the saving of many souls, that poor people may not be brought into false conceits of their Ministers, so that they neglect their help, and too easily hearken to false Teachers; considering that they who have been abroad know, <hi>That there is not such a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry in the world as in</hi> England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Policy</hi> 7. Father <hi>R.</hi> would usually say, <hi>That the best way to work upon the English, was to make use of their natural affections: and urge them with this: What is become of your fore-fathers who died in our Religion? where was your Religion before</hi> Luther?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Advice.</hi> The people are to know, that whereas the Roman Catholick way is the greatest novelty in the world, our Religion was in all ages professed by our fore-fathers, who were saved in bearing witness to the testimony of Jesus: they were not saved by Popery, but by that truth which hath been corrupted by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Policy</hi> 8. We suppose that in <hi>England</hi> after twenty years con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, they are at a loss for the Revenue; and therefore it were seasonable such a way were proposed, that on the one hand might
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52425:30"/> seem very plausible to the King, the Nobility, and C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>n al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the Revenue: which will have that influence upon the people, which all your suggestions and insinuations cannot have. You know what counsel father <hi>P.</hi> give father <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>Brus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, To part, the King upon the new way of imposition by Excise, which must be setled by a Mercenary Army of horse and foot, which shall harass the Country.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Advice.</hi> Our gracious King hath spoiled this plot. However, we may hence see whence all our grievances come: not from the Government, but from the enemies and underminers of it.</p>

                  <item>2. Follow them with certain Questions, which the vulgar are not verst in. As, 1. Where was your Church before <hi>Luther?</hi> or where hath it been visible in all ages?</item>
